# StockSim
This is a Java based stock portfolio simulator that will accurately track a fake bank account to see the returns you've made. 


Why I built this?

I built this because I've an interest in finance/markets and coding. I wanted to make a project that would help me test predictions I had in the stock market without the risk of losing money. I also wanted to familiarize myself with finance libraries and APIs. This project will be a nice bridge as I continue to pursue topics like machine learning, finance, economics and mathematics in college.
